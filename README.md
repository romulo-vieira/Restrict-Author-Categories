# Restrict-Author-Categories
A simple Wordpress plugin that allows Admins to restrict the categories a user can post on.
It also blocks users to create, delete or edit existing categories.
It works on both Block and Classic editors.

This plugin was made with PHP and ReactJS.

This is my first WP plugin. I've made it so i could learn how to make one and also to help at Work. You can use, modify and extend it as you wish.
